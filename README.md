  We've converted the Internet's most popular icon libraries to Jetpack Compose Image Vectors, so you'll never run out of icons to use in your Compose apps.

## Basic Usage

Find the icon you need from ComposeIcons.com and click on the [Copy Kt] button. It will add the Jetpack Compose Image Vector to your clipboard.

Then paste the vector into your project and use it.

Use it in your project using the `Image()` composable:

```kotlin
import Check // your new icon

Image(Check, contentDescription = null)
```

Alternatively, use the `Icon()` composable from [Composables Core](https://composablescore.com) that supports tinting:

```kotlin
import Check // your new icon

Icon(Check, contentDescription = null, tint = Color.Blue)
```

## License

Each icon has a license of the respective icon library. To view each license, find the icon library at [ComposeIcons.com](https://composeicons.com)
