## Basic Usage

### For Designers

Head over to [composeicons.com](https://composeicons.com), find an icon you need an click on
the `Copy SVG` button. Then go to any design tool of your choice such as Figma and paste the icon (`âŒ˜ + V`) in your project.

### For Developers

Head over to [composeicons.com](https://composeicons.com), find the icon you need and click the `Copy Compose` button. 
It will add the Jetpack Compose Image Vector to your clipboard. Then paste the vector into your project and use it.

Use it in your project using the `Image()` composable:

```kotlin
import Check // your new icon

Image(Check, contentDescription = null)
```

Alternatively, use the `Icon()` composable from [Composables Core](https://composablescore.com) that supports tinting:

```kotlin
import Check // your new icon

Icon(Check, contentDescription = null, tint = Color.Blue)
```
